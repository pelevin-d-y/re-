I can imagine they're quite trying.We're out with my parents on Long Island at a nice beach house. Overall things are going pretty well for us all things considered. We're safe, have a lot of room, eating well, etc. My kids are playing Fortnite with my college friend'skid in Germany right now ;) I'm trying to stay sane by homeschooling the kids and writing on my blog, writing about things like global friendships and figuring out how to make it work much better on mobile.The job search was on hold for the last few weeks because no one had any idea of what was going on, especially at banks. I'll need to get back to it a little sometime soon.Was thinking about you as my kids are really into Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman. Thor is quite an interesting character ;)I look forward to do something (now illegal) with you soon!Best,RobOn Wed, Apr 8, 2020 at 6:56 PM Thor Ernstsson <thor@casualcorp.com",
