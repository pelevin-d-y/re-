The founding partner of Sopris (Andy Paul) was the head of the  healthcare practice at Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe ($20B under mgmt) before he left in 2000.  Andy is now the head of Enhanced Equity, a middle market healthcare only PE fund ($600M under mgmt), and uses Sopris to make venture investments in healthcare.   Andy knows a lot of people in the industry and we’re active in using our healthcare network to help our portfolio companies.  I’d really appreciate any healthcare related introductions that you can make that you think are worthwhile.  The more deals that  we look at the better and it also helps to know all the key players in the market.   I’ll be sure to check out Send Your Best.  I did think it was a good idea when we spoke last week.   BTW, I did a little Googling on bridge when I got back from the cigar event and I’m intrigued.  You may have unknowingly made a bridge convert.   Tha",

My son and I are staying put in Manhattan and watching the city empty out. Pretty wild.  Hope you're doing well, staying healthy, and sane. Seems like things are slowly getting a bit better. Where are you during all this?  Look forward to catching up once the world starts spinning again. To find some silver lining, cheers & happy cinco de mayo :)  - ThorFounder: Alpha | Strata256 508  9265",
